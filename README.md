## Introduction

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline. It covers each stage from data ingestion to processing and finally to storage, utilizing a robust tech stack that includes Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. Everything is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment and scalability.

## System Architecture

The project is designed with the following components:

- **Data Source**: We use `randomuser.me` API to generate random user data for our pipeline.
- **Apache Airflow**: Responsible for orchestrating the pipeline and storing fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Apache Kafka and Zookeeper**: Used for streaming data from PostgreSQL to the processing engine.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Helps in monitoring and schema management of our Kafka streams.
- **Apache Spark**: For data processing with its master and worker nodes.
- **Cassandra**: Where the processed data will be stored.
